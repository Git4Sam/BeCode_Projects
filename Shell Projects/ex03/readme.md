### Path To (`README.md`)
```markdown
# Path To

This script receives a path as an argument and checks whether it is a file or a directory, displaying its contents accordingly.

## Usage
1. Run the script: `./path_to.sh <path>`
2. Replace `<path>` with the desired path.

### Example:
```bash
./path_to.sh /home/user/myfile.txt
/home/user/myfile.txt is a file. Displaying content:
Hello, this is my file content.
